## Beginner Challenge

Your challenge is to take a file specifying a rectangular array of numbers such as the following:

     5    -7    -2    -1
    -5     8     2     0
    -8    -3     5    -3

[rect1.txt](rect1.txt)

and find a sub-rectangle within which adds up to the largest possible sum.

For example, in the above, the largest sum sub-rectangle is

     8     2
    -3     5

with a sum of 12

whereas

     8     2     0
    -3     5    -3

would only have a sum of 9.
