### Level 3
Take as input opening hours as a string e.g. "Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00,13:00-17:30; Sa 08:00-12:00" 
([specification](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours) ) and a specific DateTime and 
have the program tell you whether the business is open at that time or not. 
Doesn't sound super advanced but it's kinda tricky when you get into handling errors an corner-cases and optimizing.
