# Challenge Projects
Here are a list of challenge projects by month in reverse order

## November 2019

### Level 1
Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

### Level 2
Have the user enter a 3-letter IATA code for an Airport (e.g LHR) and output the full name of the airport. You can get a list of the top 30  [here](https://www.world-airport-codes.com/world-top-30-airports.html). Wikipedia has a longer list [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_by_IATA_and_ICAO_code).

Check that the input is three letters long - if not handle the error. 
_Hint_ - think about how you validate input (length and case), and what data structure you would use to store the code / name. 


### Level 3
Take as input opening hours as a string e.g. "Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00,13:00-17:30; Sa 08:00-12:00" and a specific DateTime and have the program tell you whether the business is open at that time or not. 

See this ([specification](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours) ) for opening hours. 

It doesn't sound super advanced but it's kinda tricky when you get into handling errors an corner-cases and optimizing.
