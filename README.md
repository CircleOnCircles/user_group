# Aberdeen Python User Group

## Aberdeen Python Group is Back!

We're restarting the Aberdeen Python Group on the second Wednesday of every month. This will start on **Weds 8th July**. This will be fully online for now and we'll use Zoom as the platform.

The format will be:

30 minute talk on a topic
90 minute group activities (two levels - beginner and intermediate) and then
30 min demo of outcomes of group activities.
The first session on Weds 8th July will feature a talk by Lee Christie: Git and GitHub: Version Control and Social Coding

For more info and discussion and to take part in a poll to determine what time the sessions will start please ensure that you have joined and are checking messages on the [Slack Group](https://join.slack.com/t/python-aberdeen/shared_invite/zt-fe4vr06d-TavzVV4ZusCxYLEdCqxsyQ).

We've also pencilled in a session on Web Scraping on Weds 12th August. More details will be posted on Slack.

See you there.
